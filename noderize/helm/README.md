# httpbin

This is a helm chart that deploys targeted application and a Tyk API.

1. In `image` section, configure the application image tag. Alternatively, modify `appVersion` in `Charts.yaml`
```
image:
  repository: docker.io/kong/httpbin
  pullPolicy: IfNotPresent
  # Overrides the image tag whose default is the chart appVersion.
  tag: ""
```

2. In `api` section, configure listenPath of the Tyk API
```
api:
  listenPath: /httpbin
```

3. To install manually using Helm
```
kubectl create ns apps
helm install httpbin . -n apps -f values-dev.yaml
```

4. To roll out a new version of your application on Dev / Staging / Production environment

Modify values.yaml of the target environment with which application version (image tag) to be deployed. The API manifests could also be templated for different environments easily.

5. To test the API
```
curl {GATEWAY_URL}/httpbin/get
```
